			<h1>Lab 9: Javascript for the Web</h1>
			<p id=>Working with a partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
			<h2>- Challenges -</h2>
			<p id=>One of the challenges we faced in the beginning was finding our output and assigning it
        to variable outputEl because of issues with capitalization we discovered by looking at the console.
      Also later in the lab I learned that you aren't supposed to name new elements whatever you want,
    instead they should probably be called 'html' or 'p'.</p>
			<h2>- Problems -</h2>
			<p id=> Our biggest problem was appending both new elements using appendChild() to our output div,
        we were made aware that this was the source of our issue by looking at the console. We tried adjusting many
        things in the console and searched on the web for solutions, finally figuring out that we needed to
        insert the phrase 'defer' into our script line in our HTML. I also had a problem getting the right things
        as my outputs but that was becauase I changed both of my HTML attributes to new1El accidently.</p>

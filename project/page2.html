    <h2>Question 1</h2>
     <h3>Scenario: Its a bright sunny day and you have enough time to stretch your legs before your next class.</h3>
     <button id="button1"> I. Get outside and get some exercise.</button>
     <div id = 'p1' class = 'reveal1'><p>correct: regular exercise reduces stress, anxiety, tension, fatigue and depression,
       and also vitamin D helps our brains release chemicals which improve our mood, like endorphins and serotonin </p></div>
    <button id="button2" >II. Stay inside and try to squeeze in another assignment before class.</button>
    <div id = 'p2' class = 'reveal2'> <p>wrong: staying inside for great lengths of time can build up anxiety and restlessness.
      Too much time alone and being too occupied by screen-based activities makes us withdraw from friends and loved ones.</p></div>
